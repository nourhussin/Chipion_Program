# Chipion Program
The Chipion program is an annual educational long-term project that focuses on the Electronics Engineering field, mainly digital design, and provides students with technical sessions, workshops, and a final project to make sure that they apply what they have learned. The program is held by IEEE SSCS AlexSC and VLSI-Egypt Alexandria Section for many consecutive years.

# Overview
The Chipion program consists of four phases, each covering different topics in digital design and computer architecture:

1. **Digital Design and Small Test Benches using Verilog**: In this phase, you will study introductory concepts such as Verilog vs VHDL, levels of abstractions, design process, FPGA and ASIC, implementation of combinational logic circuits, data types and operations, write test benches, sequential circuits in Verilog using FF, synchronous and asynchronous reset, blocking and nonblocking statements, finite state machine, and two projects: SBQM and UART.

2. **Computer Architecture and Microarchitecture of MIPS 32 and into to RISC-V**: This phase covers introductory concepts in Computer Architecture (CA) and microarchitecture, including Arithmetic circuits, number systems, sequential building blocks, memory arrays, logic arrays, assembly language, machine language programming, addressing modes, compiling assembling and loading, odds and ends, instruction formats, performance analyses, single cycle processor, multi-cycle processor, pipelined processor, advanced microarchitecture, and project MIPS single cycle processor.

3. **System Verilog for Verification**: This phase introduces main verification system blocks, interfaces, procedural statements and routines, classes and OOP, randomization, constraints, mailboxes, threads interprocess, functional coverage, and project.

4. **FPGA and ASIC Flow (UVM Concepts)**: In this phase, you will learn about logic synthesis, STA (Static Timing Analysis), clock domain crossing, floor planning, verification techniques, consuming time methodologies, UVM blocks, hierarchy test, and ports types based on system, agent, driver, monitor, coverage.

# Project Goals
This repository contains files related to my experiments in the Chipion program. I will be sharing codes and projects that I have worked on during the course of the program. The goal is to learn and contribute to the electronics industry in Egypt through practical experience.

# Acknowledgment
We would like to thank IEEE SSCS AlexSC and VLSI-Egypt Alexandria Section for organizing this program every year and providing students with the opportunity to learn about digital design and computer architecture. We would also like to thank the professional mentors who guide and empower young engineers through the challenges and demands of their career lives, and provide the knowledge and information that cannot be found in academic content and college curricula.
